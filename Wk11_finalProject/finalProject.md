###Final Project

For my final project, I want to create a visual that is part artwork, part data visualization and addresses reactions/responses to Donald Trump's recent election. 

The final product will be a visually interesting and not entirely abstract work that features footage from one of the protests that is distorted using mesh overlay by the fluctuating heart rate of a student protest participant.
The footage will also be distorted by color which changes according to the heart rate. 

I hope this peice will be able to illustrate the very real emotions of people from marginalized communities who are fearful for their futures under President Elect Trump; and that it will combat arguments that those protesting are acting immmature, ""throwing tantrums", ""being babies"", or acting irrationally.
