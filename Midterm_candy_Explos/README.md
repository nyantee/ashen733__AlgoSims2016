Concept Statement 


I wanted to create something had has a sort of alien or psychedelic aestethic. So I used a series of particle systems to generate this outer-space evoking, abstract piece. 

I enjoyed creating the piece because of the different opportunities for various compositional arrangements within one run of the project.
