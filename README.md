###Nyantee's Creative Coding Repo

Week 1 save

Exercise A

I changed the percentage in the shaper formula to which made it move really fast across the screen. After that I could only see the end position, not the start. So I slowed the frame rate down to draw every 50 frames and that made it measurable. When I timed it then it took 61 seconds to move across 11cm, but I obviously altered the speed I perceived by slowing the framerate so that I could press stop and start on my timer. So I'm not sure I did that correctly. 


Exercise B

I couldn't get the mousePressed() function to work and I was confused about why it takes variables even after reading the chapter in OF, so I experimented with keypressed() instead.

Exercise D

I couldn't figure out how to make the variable catchUpSpeed = 0.03; or the pct readable in other parts of my code. So I did not know how to adjust it for each object when building my ofApp.cpp file.



Week 2







Week 3


Not sure why my volcano and fireworks drawings both start with a line or box of particles moving slowly up the screen before the actual animation begins or how to fix that.
