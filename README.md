###Nyantee's Creative Coding Repo

Week 1 save

Exercise A

I changed the percentage in the shaper formula to which made it move really fast across the screen. After that I could only see the end position, not the start. So I slowed the frame rate down to draw every 50 frames and that made it measurable. When I timed it then it took 61 seconds to move across 11cm, but I obviously altered the speed I perceived by slowing the framerate so that I could press stop and start on my timer. So I'm not sure I did that correctly. 


Exercise B

I couldn't get the mousePressed() function to work and I was confused about why it takes variables even after reading the chapter in OF, so I experimented with keypressed() instead.

Exercise D

I couldn't figure out how to make the variable catchUpSpeed = 0.03; or the pct readable in other parts of my code. So I did not know how to adjust it for each object when building my ofApp.cpp file.



Week 2







Week 3


Not sure why my volcano and fireworks drawings both start with a line or box of particles moving slowly up the screen before the actual animation begins or how to fix that.


Week 4

I spent most of my time for this homework trying to figure out a way to most effeciently build the solar system. I tried using arrays in one of the attempts I posted and then individual objects in another. I was trying to cement my knowledge of arrays and how to use them.


Week 5

For exercise A I wanted to create a series of springs in a row made of blocks that were of different heights so that when the program opened each would spring form a stretched point in successions but I couldn't figure out how to make the spring into an object successfully which is what i was trying to do with the NOARRAY version in my homework folder. 

For exercise B, I figured out how to add a GUI to the drawing to change the size of the box spring. 



Week 6

Exercise A

For exercise A, I simply played around with the number of cars. I wanted to make an array but I ran out of time, though I know this would have been a good opportunity to exercise one.

Exercise B

I borrowed this code from Tao's GitHub because my wasn't working and I started to play with the numbers in it. I wanted to make it look like a ski line with people floating down the line in ski lifts, but my image would not load properly. 

Exercise C

The class flocking exampes in the class folder wouldn't work on my computer. I tried copy and pasting Vivian's code from her GitHub and using the OF debug trick that we used but couldn't figure it out. So for this exercise, I applied the 3D effect to the seek and avoid example. 



Week 9

Exercise A

I used perlin noise to make  a wave form that moves across the page

Exercise B

I change the direction of the vector feild with mousex and mousey and with a GUI

Exercise C

I was experimenting with different ways to effect the amount of noise in the example through GUIs but didn't get very far
